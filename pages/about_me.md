## Nice to meet you

My name is Christopher Beard, and I'm a former Real Estate Appraiser turned __Front-End Web Developer__.
<br>
<small>_You can read more about my journey [here](#)._</small>

I'm a lifelong learner who loves taking on new challenges, especially when it comes to cutting-edge technologies.  

I thrive in the intersection between __creativity__ and __logic__, solving real world problems
with a fresh and multidisciplinary approach.

In the last __7 years__ _of my web development career_, I have become well versed in a wide array of client side development techniques and disciplines that enable me to provide superior user experiences.

Along the way, I've developed a skill base that is broader than a typical front-end developer's - I'm also a designer that takes pride in creating sublime user interfaces.

My hobbies include audio production, video editing, and writing.

I believe the web can fundamentally improve people's lives, and I'm always looking for inspiring work that will allow me to contribute in meaningful ways.

## Skills

 - Responsive Web Design.
 - Client-side and NodeJS development.
 - UI/UX Blueprinting and Design.
 - Linux server setup and administration.
 - Graphic Design.
 - Version control, automated testing/build/deployment.
 - Video editing and animation.
 - Audio Production.

I currently develop in __Javascript__, and regularly make use of libraries such as __React__, __React Native__ and __NodeJS__.
I love __CSS3__, and enjoy utilizing CSS Preprocessors like __Sass__ and __Stylus__ in order to craft unique and responsive user interfaces.  

In addition, I am thoroughly acquainted with __MongoDB__ and several __Relational Databases__. I am currently in the process of learning __GraphQL__, and am excited to use it in future projects.

While I primarily develop in JavaScript, I have no problem working with other languages such as  __Java__, __C#__, or __Ruby__. I view programming languages as tools in a developer's toolbox, and as such, it is important to choose the right tool for the job.

I'm always experimenting, always learning, and never bored.
